# One-Month Cybersecurity Project: VPS Security & Reconnaissance

## Project Overview

This simplified project is designed for absolute beginners to complete in one month. Students will use a Virtual Private Server (VPS) running Linux to learn essential cybersecurity skills, including basic system setup, networking, remote access, and active reconnaissance. The focus is on practical, achievable tasks that build real-world confidence.

## Project Steps

### 1. VPS Setup
- Get access to a Linux VPS (cloud provider or local VM).
- Connect to your VPS using SSH from your computer.
- Update the system and create a non-root user for daily tasks.

### 2. Linux Essentials
- Practice basic Linux commands: navigation, file management, permissions.
- Explore the file system and understand user roles.

### 3. Networking Basics
- Find your VPS's IP address and test connectivity with `ping`.
- Use `ifconfig`/`ip`, `netstat`, and `ss` to view network interfaces and open ports.

### 4. Active Reconnaissance
- Use `nmap` from your local machine to scan your VPS for open ports and services.
- Document which ports are open and what services are running.
- Research the purpose and risks of each discovered service.

### 5. Basic Hardening
- Change the default SSH port (optional, for advanced students).
- Set up a basic firewall (e.g., `ufw` or `firewalld`) to restrict access.
- Disable root login over SSH.

### 6. Reporting & Reflection
- Keep a log or screenshots of each step.
- Write a short report (1-2 pages) summarizing what you did, what you learned, and why securing a VPS is important.

## Deliverables
- Step-by-step log or screenshots.
- Final report with findings and reflections.

## Tips for Success
- Work together and help each other troubleshoot.
- Ask questions if you get stuck—learning to solve problems is key!
- Focus on understanding the basics and building confidence.
