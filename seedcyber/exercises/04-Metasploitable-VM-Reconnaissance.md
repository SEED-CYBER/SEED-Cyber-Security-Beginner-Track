# Exercise 4: Metasploitable VM Reconnaissance

## Exercise Overview

This exercise is designed for beginners and intermediate students to gain hands-on experience with basic Linux and cybersecurity skills. You will set up a Metasploitable virtual machine (VM) and perform active reconnaissance to discover its vulnerabilities.

## Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- Install a Linux distribution (Ubuntu recommended) on your computer or in a virtual machine.
- Download and set up the Metasploitable VM as a target for security testing.
- Learn and practice basic Linux commands for navigation and file management.

### 2. Network Discovery
- Find the IP address of your Metasploitable VM and your Linux machine.
- Use `ping` to test connectivity between your Linux machine and the Metasploitable VM.

### 3. Active Reconnaissance
- Use `nmap` to scan the Metasploitable VM for open ports and running services.
- Record which ports are open and what services are detected.
- Research what each discovered service does and why it might be vulnerable.

### 4. Basic Security Tools
- Use `whois`, `dig`, and `traceroute` to gather more information about the network (optional for advanced students).
- Practice connecting to the Metasploitable VM using SSH (if enabled).

### 5. Reporting
- Take screenshots or save terminal output for each step.
- Write a short summary (1-2 pages) describing what you found and what you learned about network services and vulnerabilities.

## Deliverables

To complete this exercise, submit the following:

- Screenshots of each major step (setup, network discovery, nmap scan, security tools, and reporting).
- A short summary report (1-2 pages) describing your process, findings, and what you learned.
- Make sure your screenshots clearly show your terminal commands and results.
