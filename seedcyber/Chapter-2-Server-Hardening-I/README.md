# Chapter 2: Server Hardening I – Access & Network Controls

**Duration:** Week 2 (5 days)  
**Prerequisite:** Chapter 1 complete  
**Level:** Intermediate

## Overview

Close unauthorized access vectors through firewall configuration, SSH hardening, and intrusion prevention. Implement network-level defenses.

## Learning Objectives

By end of Week 2, you will:

✓ Harden SSH with key-only authentication and root login disabled  
✓ Configure UFW/iptables firewall rules  
✓ Implement Fail2Ban to prevent brute-force attacks  
✓ Perform network scanning with Nmap  
✓ Port scan your own VPS to verify security  
✓ Create an access-controlled VPS with documented firewall policies

## Weekly Project Task

**Deploy a hardened VPS with firewall and intrusion prevention:**

1. Disable root SSH access
2. Enforce key-only authentication  
3. Configure firewall allowing only essential ports
4. Deploy Fail2Ban for attack prevention
5. Simulate brute-force attacks
6. Document all firewall rules
7. Submit security justification report
8. Show evidence of blocked unauthorized access
