## Ethical Exploitation

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Only exploit systems you own or have written permission to test.

```bash
# Lab environment:
# 1. Vulnerable VM intentionally set up
# 2. Isolated network
# 3. All exploitation logged and documented

# Safe practice:
# - Use virtual machines
# - Air-gapped networks
# - Document all activities
```
